This repository builds upon code made by Maytal Katz from the Lampl lab (Dept of Brain Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science), which [processes behavior data](https://github.com/maytalkatz/Psychometric-Data-Analysis).

The code has been modified specifically for the experiments I am running, which is a simplified version of the experiments done by Maytal. The code is hence much simpler.

This repository contains:

1. The `behav` folder containing relevant Python scripts which are used by the front-end.
2. The front-end Jupyter notebook `behav_analysis.ipynb` which walks the user through the gross processing pipeline to generate plots for specific [optogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics) stimulations.
3. The folder `C2` containing behavior data that is to be analyzed.

This repository uses an old version of the module [`psignifit`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14750140) developed by the [Wichmann lab](doi:10.1016/j.visres.2016.02.002).
