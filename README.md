This repository builds upon code made by Maytal Katz from the same lab (Ilan Lampl, Dept of Brain Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science) which [processes behavior data](https://github.com/maytalkatz/Psychometric-Data-Analysis).

The aims of this repository include:
1. Adding a front-end Jupyter notebook to enable ease-of-use
2. Adding feature to categorize results according to specific [optogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics) epochs.
